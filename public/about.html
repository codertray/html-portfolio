    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a visually impaired creator from Great falls montana. My vision was limited at birth due to
      Septo-Optic Dysplasia. a disease that caused the cones in the back of my eyes to be slightly 
      maldeveloped. when it comes to hobbies, Despite my vision i've always loved photography, and 
      videogames. I love a good audiobook too.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I love to keep busy, so i've had many projects over the years. While none of them have become
      careers, i've learned from all of them
